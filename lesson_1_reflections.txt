Good resource for comparing text files.
Windows version seems more friendly for small changes, 
but to see the whole file in the linux version is also nice.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a 
file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
-It would be good.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing 
when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having 
versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
It's logically connected so makes more sense.
-Autosaving isn't practical based on saving in the middle of 
-code changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, 
allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, 
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
-Because some files are related to other files, so it
-is handy to have them save together.
